# PLEA2020-Indoor-Daylight-Distribution-Prediction
Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models Optimized by Bayesian Algorithm for Indoor Daylight Distribution Prediction



## The Code
A basic script to train and optimizae the model is provided. 
Before run the code, make sure you have sklearn, skopt, numpy, pandas, xgboost library installed with pip. 

The dataset is simulated with Harbin CSWD epw file.
The result include optimization record and the MLP model(others are not included because they are too large - over 100MB)
